        <h2>What are the benefits of using container as development environment</h2>
<p>- Develop on the same operating system you deploy to or use larger or more specialized hardware.</p>
<p><br />- Sandbox your development environment to avoid impacting your local machine configuration.</p>
<p><br />- Use tools or runtimes not available on your local OS or manage multiple versions of them.</p>
<p><br />- Access an existing development environment from multiple machines or locations.</p>
<p><br />- Make it easy for new contributors to get started and keep everyone on a consistent environment.</p>
<p><br />- Develop your Linux-deployed applications using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p>
<p><br />- Debug an application running somewhere else such as a customer site or in the cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits of VS Code:</p>
<p><br />- Visual Studio Code Remote Development allows you to use a container, remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.</p>
<p><br />- Containers for development env eliminate the complexity of setting up for different teams</p>
